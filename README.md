# Real Time Visual Content Creation - Overview and Comparison

This Repository tries to compile information about programmable real time video processing environments.\\
Not included are environments that are so broad that one could do just about everything (like C++) or complete tools without the need or possibility to program anything(or very little, such as resolume).

*Discliamer*: The author of this document is basically a TouchDesigner/Max/python/GLSL guy doing live performances and installations in an art context. Any bias towards these tools/needs are tried to be avoided but probably inevitable.

## Environments
### Short List
Environments listed here are headed towards creation and/or manipulation of real-time video content as a big part of their whole purpose. Environments excluded here are tools that arguably have a different purpose as a whole. Also excluded are unreleased, unstable or outdated environments.
